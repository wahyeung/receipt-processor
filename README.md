This is a lightweight backend service that accepts receipt data, calculates points based on specific rules, and allows querying the point total by receipt ID.

Built for the **Fetch Backend Engineer Apprenticeship** project.

3. +25 points if the total is a multiple of 0.25.
4. +5 points for every two items.
5. +ceil(price * 0.2) for items whose trimmed description length is a multiple of 3.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Unit tests are written using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to verify the correctness of the scoring logic.

To run tests:

```bash
npm test
```
You can find the test cases in tests/scoring.test.js.

A total of 5 automated unit tests are provided, covering all 7 scoring rules, including edge cases and combined logic scenarios.
